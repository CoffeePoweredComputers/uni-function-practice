# Fun with Functions - Instructions

The learning objectives of this lab are as follows:
1. Importing the contents of one Python script into another script.
2. Practicing creating functions with what you have learned so far in the course.
3. Testing your functions via the `assert` operator.
4. Reading doc strings


## Assignment Files
For this assignment you have given the following files:
1. functions.py: This file contains various function headers and docstrings indicating what task the function is to perform once you have completed it.
2. main.py: This is the file in which you will:
    * Call functions with certain parameters.
    * Check to see if the function ran correctly using assert


## Git Command Reminders
* git add <filename>: To add a file's changes to the staging area.
* git commit -m "a message here": To create a commit with the contents of the staging area.
* git push: To push the local commits to remote (GitHub repo).
